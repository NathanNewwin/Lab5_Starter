Make sure you make a PR to your own repo's main and not the class' repo!! Otherwise you will lose points!!

Pt 3. Check Understanding
1. I wouldn't write a unit test for the "message" feature since there are multiple parts for the "message" feature that I wouldn't be able to do a unit test on it(UI, network/server stuff, delivery, etc).
2. I would write a unit test for the "max message length" feature because it is a single piece of the entire "message" feature that would either give an accept or reject if the message is longer than 80 chars. If this feature was ever changed to be longer or shorter, the unit test could easily account for the change too.
